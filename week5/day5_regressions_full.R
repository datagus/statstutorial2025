#only choose independent variables that do not correlate with each other

## Let's take a closer look at London

# select London for multiple regression
London <- air[city == 'London',]

detach(air)
attach(London)

# data inspection
dim(London)
summary(London)

# multiple regression with price as dependent and three characteristics as independent variables

# multiple regression with guest satisfaction as dependent and four characteristics as independent variables

# compare London with other cities
detach(London)
attach(air)
boxplot(guest_satis ~ city)
boxplot(price ~ city)

#now try multiple regression with other cities....
